This section contains my web development file.
The airline baggage handling system can be found here:http://cs.ashesi.edu.gh/~nicholas.quansah/website/web/
It works in a way that passengers enter their details and it goes into an online database for technical workers 
at the airport to change the status of the baggage upon arrival in the particular destination.
The passenger upon arrival check the status of the baggage to see whether his or her baggage arrived at his or her destination.
